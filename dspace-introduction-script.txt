Hi everbody, this is X, I am Y, and we want to talk to you about Dspace today.

Who has ever heard the term "DSpace" before?

...

[NEXT] -> Question

We want to start with a question:
If life was a computer game, which features are missing in the interface?

...

[NEXT] -> street Boring

[NEXT] -> street dspaced

This is the vision we have, where we want to go.
We are not there yet, but we have all the basic building blocks together.
And that's what we're going to show you today...

[NEXT] -> TOC

Split into 
Who we are,
what we want
what we have
and what we need

[NEXT] -> #Who we are

While the two of us give you this presentation today
there are more people heavily involved in this project.
we are a small group of software hackers and we do this in our free time, so this gets us to what we want:

[NEXT] -> #What do we want: Something like a standard

TODO: Remove staging slide!

We want to start something like a standard. We are not a startup and are not looking for a business model here.

We were inspired by the origin of the www, and we want to establish a framework of 
federated
free (as in beer and as in speech)
open-sourced
loosly coupled
and extendable
components

tim berners lee put the concept of cross-referenced publications to the electronic realm, when he created the Web at cern
and in that spirit we want to work upon maps,
starting with the fundamental Basemap:

[NEXT] -> #What do we need?

[NEXT] -> Directory Server

What we need in the sense that it has not yet been done:
a directory server, where all the basmaps and overlay feeds can be registered and be accessed by the client.

It would have to be
federated, the directory should sync between instances
searchable, so the served results can be filterd by the request of the client. to do that efficiently,:
there should be some kind of user-based ranking or voting system to sort entries by importance and filter out spam
there should be metadata that states the region the map or overlay covers 
and keywords to classify and search upon the entries

to do this, we are thinking about a format that has as attributes
the url where to actually access the data (which is also a good primary index)
type, which distinguishes basmaps and overlays 
topleft and bottomright, which are coordinates for the enclosing rectangle of the area of interest.
and attributes for the search.

so the directory server would manage a list of such entries, sync them between instances and serve them to the client.

[NEXT] -> Client

For the client, we have to provide more functionality for overlays.
For the moment, we just render simple points with markers, but we want to
put arbitrary polygons on the map, which we started with the routing
put translated images on the map, so you can make overlays out of floorplans of buildings etc.
put 3d geometry on the map, for representation of structures and more

because the world outside is so crucial for dspace, we really have to focus on mobile usabilty. it has to be comfortable and efficient to use on the smartphones and tablets running ios and android.

and we are really looking forward to what we can do with google glass,
bringing us one step closer to the video game interface in the beginning

Related to the directory server, we need a browser for overlays (and also basemaps), (Maybe we should call it directory browser?), where we can search for data

Encryption is another thing we want to put a focus on, we omitted it in the beginning, to focus on the core technology, but we want to provide good tools to protect privacy.

[NEXT] -> Collaboration

TODO: irc here?



[NEXT] -> End
